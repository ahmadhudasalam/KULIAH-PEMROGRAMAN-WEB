            <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reluctantly called time on his United playing career on 28 August 2007 – 11 years and three days after it began with a goalscoring debut. On the field, the Norwegian became an embodiment of the Reds’ never-say-die spirit in their most successful decade, often scoring late goals when points or trophies looked to have been lost. But off the field, he finally had to admit one defeat - in his battle with a persistent knee injury.</p>
            <p>After nearly two years out of management, Solskjaer once again took charge at Molde, but just before Christmas in 2018, he received a call he just could not turn down - Manchester United. After Jose Mourinho's departure from the manager's position at Old Trafford, Ole was appointed as caretaker boss and remarkably won his first eight matches in the hot seat. He also oversaw one of United’s greatest ever European comebacks, when the Reds beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 at the Parc de Princes to qualify for the quarter-final stage of the Champions League. Solskjaer was subsequently made permanent manager, signing a three-year contract on 28 March 2019. Reacting to his appointment, the Norwegian said: "It’s truly an honour. I think everyone knows, and I’ve spoken about it in the last few months, that this is the dream job for anyone interested in football, especially anyone who has been involved with Manchester United. Being given the opportunity now to move the club forward, with all its potential, is fantastic.”</p>
